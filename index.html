      <p>Noticeable trends: Zipcodes 94102 and 94103 have a significantly more amount of dispatch calls than all other zipcodes. Neighborhoods in these zipcodes include South of Market and Hayes Valley. These are heavily populated areas in downtown SF, which is a possible explanation for the high volume of dispatches.<br><br>Of all the dispatches, most are deemed potentially life threatening, with very few fires but a solid amount of non life threatening and alarm dispatches.<br><br>Zipcodes 94104, 94129, and 94130 have very few dispatches to. These neighborhoods are the financial district, Presidio, and Treasure Island. Presidio is a big park with a golf course, trails, and overlooks. Treasure Island is a tourist attraction with 2,000 people living there. It is realistic to understand why so few dispatches are in these two areas.</p>
